    "`Answer`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) - An example of AI is a chatbot like Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa. These virtual assistants can understand natural language and carry out tasks like setting reminders, answering questions, or playing music. They use complex algorithms and machine learning techniques to interpret and respond to human input.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Machine Learning - An example of machine learning is a spam email filter. The algorithm learns from previous examples of spam emails to identify patterns and then uses this information to filter out similar emails in the future. With each new example, the algorithm becomes more accurate at detecting spam emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Deep Learning - An example of deep learning is image recognition. A deep learning algorithm, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN), can analyze millions of images and learn to identify patterns in the data, such as shapes, colors, and textures. Once trained, the CNN can accurately recognize and classify new images, such as identifying whether a picture contains a dog or a cat or more complex like human."

    "`Q2: What is supervised learning? List some examples  of supervised learning.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Answer:`\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where we train the computer algorithm using labeled data. It's like giving the computer a set of examples and telling it what each example represents, and then asking it to generalize that knowledge to new, unseen examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, imagine that you have a bunch of pictures of animals, and you want to teach the computer to recognize which animals are cats and which are dogs. You would give the computer a set of labeled examples, where each picture is labeled as either \"cat\" or \"dog\". The computer would then learn to recognize the key features that distinguish cats from dogs and use that knowledge to predict the label of new, unseen pictures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of supervised learning include image classification, where the computer learns to identify different objects in images; sentiment analysis, where the computer learns to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral; and fraud detection, where the computer learns to identify fraudulent transactions based on historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is a fundamental technique in machine learning, and it has many applications in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and predictive modeling."

    "Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the computer algorithm is trained on a dataset without any labeled examples. The algorithm looks for patterns and relationships in the data on its own. Examples of unsupervised learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection. Unsupervised learning is useful for discovering hidden patterns in complex data and has many applications in various fields."

    "Train-test-validation split is a technique used in machine learning to divide a dataset into three subsets: a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The purpose of this split is to evaluate the performance of a model on data it has not seen during training and to prevent overfitting.\n",

    "Training set: The training set is used to create a model that can generalize to new, unseen data. A larger training set will lead to a better model, but there is a tradeoff between the size of the training set and the ability to tune the hyperparameters of the model.\n",

    "One common unsupervised learning algorithm used for anomaly detection is clustering. In clustering, the algorithm identifies groups of data points that are similar to each other based on some measure of similarity, such as distance or density. Data points that do not belong to any cluster or belong to a very small cluster may be considered anomalies.\n",

Anomalies in the data may result in poor reconstruction performance, and the reconstruction error can be used to detect anomalies."
